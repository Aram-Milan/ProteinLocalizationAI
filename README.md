# ProteinLocalizationAI

This repository contains the group project about Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, focusing on classifying protein cellular localization using machine learning models.

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify the cellular localization sites of proteins using the yeast dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset after pre-processing consists of 1,300 data points, 8 continuous features, and 4 distinct classes (CYT, NUC, MIT, ME3).

## Models Used
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Tuned using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
- **Decision Trees**: Optimized for feature importance and generalization.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing, including feature scaling and class balancing.
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Comparison of model performance.

## Repository Structure
- `Intro_to_AI-Group14.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project code and analysis.
- `yeast_data.csv`: Dataset used for training and evaluating the models.
- `.gitattributes`: Git configuration file.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/`: Automatically generated checkpoints by Jupyter (can be ignored).

## Dataset
The yeast dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
